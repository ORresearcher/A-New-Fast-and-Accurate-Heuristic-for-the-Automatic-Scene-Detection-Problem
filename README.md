# A-New-Fast-and-Accurate-Heuristic-for-the-Automatic-Scene-Detection-Problem

This is the repository for the paper "A New Fast and Accurate Heuristic for the Automatic Scene Detection Problem", authored by D. Catanzaro, R. Pesenti, and R. Ronco.<br>

According to the notation used in Section 4, the folder I1 contains the data relevant to the instances solvable with Heuristic-Partitioner, Rotman-T and Rotman-H, while the folder I2 contains the data relevant to the instances only solvable with Heuristic-Partitioner on our 24GB RAM hardware.<br>
