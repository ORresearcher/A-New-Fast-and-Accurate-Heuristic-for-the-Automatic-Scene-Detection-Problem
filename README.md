# A-New-Fast-and-Accurate-Heuristic-for-the-Automatic-Scene-Detection-Problem

This is the repository for the paper "A New Fast and Accurate Heuristic for the Automatic Scene Detection Problem", authored by D. Catanzaro, R. Pesenti, and R. Ronco.<br>

The folder "src"

According to the notation used in Section 4, the folder "I1" contains the data relevant to the instances solvable with Heuristic-Partitioner, Rotman-T and Rotman-H, while the folder "I2" contains the data relevant to the instances only solvable with Heuristic-Partitioner (on our 24GB RAM hardware).<br>

Each instance "i" is associated with the two files "i.npy" and "i.txt": the former contains the numpy encoding of the distance matrix associated to the video "i", while the latter contains the ground-truth partition of "i".
